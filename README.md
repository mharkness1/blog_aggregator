# Future Extensions

- Add sorting and filtering options to the browse command
- Add pagination to the browse command
- Add concurrency to the agg command so that it can fetch more frequently
- Add a search command that allows for fuzzy searching of posts
- Add bookmarking or liking posts
- Add a TUI that allows you to select a post in the terminal and view it in a more readable format (either in the terminal or open in a browser)
- Add an HTTP API (and authentication/authorization) that allows other users to interact with the service remotely
- Write a service manager that keeps the agg command running in the background and restarts it if it crashes
